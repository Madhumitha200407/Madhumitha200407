## Hi, I'm Madhu✨

🌟 I'm a B.Tech student specializing in Information Technology, with a passion for uncovering stories hidden in data.  

💡 I enjoy transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights using tools like Python, SQL, and Power BI. 

🔎 Currently exploring data visualization, analytics, and building projects that make data more meaningful and accessible. 

🎶 Outside of tech, you’ll often find me making music, sharing songs, and expressing creativity in new ways

⭐ *Fun fact:* I believe that every dataset has a hidden story — and every song has a hidden emotion waiting to be shared.
